# Thoughtful Skills

Skills for AI coding agents to use [Thoughtful](https://thoughtful.app) as a collaborative knowledge layer.

**Why Thoughtful over markdown files?** Thoughtful is web-based with mobile and desktop apps, real-time multiplayer collaboration, and team chat. Capture strategy on your phone, collaborate with non-technical teammates, and connect it to your git workflow rather than being driven by it.
